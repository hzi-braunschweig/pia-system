  '      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n' +
  '      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n' +
  '\n' +
  '   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n' +
  '      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n' +
  '      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n' +
  '      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n' +
  '      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n' +
  '      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n' +
  '      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n' +
  '      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n' +
  '      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n' +
  '      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n' +
