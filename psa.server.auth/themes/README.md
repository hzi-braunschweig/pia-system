# Creating Themes

Themes are used to configure the look and feel of login pages and the account management console.

Custom themes packaged in a JAR file should be deployed to the `${kc.home.dir}/providers` directory and you should run
the `config` command to install them prior to running the server.

You should also be able to create your custom themes in this directory, directly. Themes within this directory do not require
the `config` command to install them.

When running the server in development mode, themes are not cached so that you can easily work on them without any need to restart
the server when making changes.

See the theme section in the [Server Developer Guide](https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/server_development/#_themes) for more details about how to create custom themes.

## Overriding the built-in templates

While creating custom themes especially when overriding templates it may be useful to use the built-in templates as
a reference. These can be found and downloaded in the maven repository https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.keycloak/keycloak-themes.

**Built-in themes should not be modified directly, instead a custom theme should be created.**
