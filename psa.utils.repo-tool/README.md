# psa.utils.repo-tool

The repo-tool scans the directories under `REPO_DIR` for `Dockerfile` and `package.json`.
With the gathered information it can run various tasks on the repository.

## Usage

```bash
npm run build && npm start -- $COMMAND
```

## Help

A helper page for the tool can be shown by running the following command:

```bash
npm run build && npm start -- -h
```

## Generator

This is a generator for a `.gitlab-ci.yml` file.
With the found files and the templates from the `templates` directory, it creates jobs for a `.gitlab-ci.yml`.
It also creates dockerfiles, that are used inside the ci (and local tests), under the `generated` folder.

```bash
npm run generate
```

### NOTE

we can not use docker run with mounted files from the repo in the ci because the ci is executed inside a container.
This means the paths we see there are not the real paths on the host.
Therefore, we don't know the real paths on the host and can not mount them inside a docker run.

## Test

This command can be used to run all the tests on the local developer machine.

```bash
npm run test
```

## Update

Can be used to run `npm update` on all services.

```bash
npm run update
```

## Outdated

Can be used to run `npm outdated` on all services.

```bash
npm run outdated
```

## Licensecollector

The LicenceCollector collects all licenses of the npm packages used in this project and adds a list of the deposited
licenses for the Docker images used.

Since the licensecollector uses the currently installed `node_modules`, you should make sure that all dependencies have
been installed beforehand. Otherwise, there is a high risk that the collected data will be outdated.
To do this, first run `npm ci` in the root directory and then run `./node_modules/.bin/lerna --ci`.

To run the LicenceCollector, you can then execute `npm run build && npm run license` in this directory.

The LicenceCollector creates 3 files:

- psa.app.mobile/src/assets/licenses.json (contains all prod-dependencies of the mobile-app)
- psa.app.web/src/assets/licenses.json (contains all prod-dependencies of the web-app)
- THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES (contains all dependencies of all modules and the Docker image licenses).
